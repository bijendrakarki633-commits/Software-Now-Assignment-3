A Python-based image editing application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter, OpenCV, and Pillow (PIL). This project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, class interaction, and modular design. It allows users to load, edit, and save images with various effects, transformations, and adjustable settings.

Features

Flip (horizontal and vertical)
It has adjustable Image Parameters
Blur feature has intensity within 0–20 
Brightness ranges from -100 to +100
Contrast ranges from 0.5 to 3.0
Resizing of the Image
It has Custom width and height with handling of aspect ratio 
It also has Reset features
It will also has feaure to Rvert to original image
It also has User Interface
Itn also area for Central image display 
It has Right sidebar with buttons and sliders in order to control it.
It has Status bar which displays image dimensions, sizee, and filename
It has Scrollable sidebar in order for  effects and settings

Technical Details
Language it uses for Programming is Python 3
Libraries like Tkinter, OpenCV, Pillow (PIL), NumPy  used in order to operate it.

Architecture:
MainApp: GUI and user interaction
ImageProcessor: Image transformations and adjustments
ImageHistory: Undo and redo management

Design Principles:

Encapsulation: Internal state managed privately (processor, history, current_file, photo_ref)
Constructor initialization: Sets up GUI, processors, and state variables

Modular methods: Each user action (open, save, apply effect, resize) has a dedicated method
